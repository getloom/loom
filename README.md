> **work in progress**: pre-alpha

felt is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) server that you can use in many different ways:

- as an <strong>end user</strong> using Felt like Slack or Discord,
  but with more power to build custom experiences for your community
- as an <strong>operator user</strong> deploying an instance to the web via servers IRL,
  doing admin and infra
- (coming soon) as a <strong>dev user</strong> making a custom server using
  [the library on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@feltjs/felt-server)
- as a <strong>dev user</strong> downloading or forking this repo with git,
  adding or changing anything you wish

## getting started

To learn about the project, see [felt.dev/about](https://felt.dev/about).
We'll link to a video introduction with the alpha announcement.

To play with the code, see
[Getting started](https://www.felt.dev/docs/guide/admin/getting-started) and
[Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).
Docs are a work-in-progress at
[felt.dev/docs](https://www.felt.dev/docs),
including our
[known issues](https://www.felt.dev/docs/guide/user/known-issues).

To deploy to production, see
[Deploying production](https://www.felt.dev/docs/guide/admin/deploying-production)
and [Managing production](https://www.felt.dev/docs/guide/admin/managing-production).

The server has integrated reference docs, which we'll link after the alpha announcement.
We also publish [our vocabulary as a JSON Schema](/src/static/schemas/vocab.json).

## using `@feltjs/felt-server` as a library

> support for this coming soon - it's published to npm but not yet usable

[`@feltjs/felt-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@feltjs/felt-server)
can be installed as a library on npm to make custom servers:

```bash
npm i -D @feltjs/felt-server # see the available modules at `/src/gro.config.ts`
```

Learn more about
[using `@feltjs/felt-server` as a library](https://www.felt.dev/docs/guide/dev/library-usage).

## using `@feltjs/felt` as a git repo

To work directly on the codebase,
see [Getting started](https://www.felt.dev/docs/guide/admin/getting-started), then:

```bash
# node >=20.5
npm i

# start SvelteKit/Vite and the Node server
npm run dev

# browse to localhost:5173 or whatever it says

# you can also run `gro dev` with Gro installed globally:
npm i -g @feltjs/gro
gro # print available tasks
gro dev # args are forwarded to `vite` like `npm run dev`

npm test
# or
gro test
```
