# Contributing to `@getloom/loom`

Thanks for your interest in helping!
To keep our development speed up,
[@getloom](https://github.com/getloom) makes most decisions in private,
but we are planning to develop open community-driven processes soon.
Our code is open source, so we publish it as we write it,
and [the license](LICENSE) is permissive, so you can do whatever you wish with it.
See also our [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)
and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We plan to publish a public roadmap and discuss increasingly more in public.
For now please feel free to
[open issues](https://github.com/getloom/loom/issues) on GitHub,
and for private feedback email [team@getloom.org](mailto:team@getloom.org).
See also the [known issues](https://www.loom.dev/docs/guide/user/known-issues).

[Pull requests](https://github.com/getloom/loom/pulls)
are welcome for straightforward fixes and improvements,
but when there's non-obvious design choices or other ambiguities,
please open an [issue](https://github.com/getloom/loom/issues)
to work out the details with the maintainers.

To develop, see [Getting started](https://getloom.org/docs/guide/admin/getting-started)

Loom is governed by a
[Temporary Benevolent Dictator (TBD)](GOVERNANCE.md)
