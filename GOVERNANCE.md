# Temporary Benevolent Dictator (TBD)

## Basics

For now, Hamilton (@greatbacon),
the temporary benevolent dictator (TBD), holds ultimate decision-making power,
until the project & community around it (collectivly refered to as the project community) is developed enough for a more democratic model.

This Rule reflects the idea of #ExitToCommunity—that community ownership and control
is the destination even if it's not the origin.

## Participants

Participation is open to anyone who wants to join.

The TBD can remove misbehaving participants at will for the sake of the common good.

The TBD invites active, committed participants to join the Steering Committee,
whose members help the TBD in managing the project community.

In the event that the TBD is unable or unwilling to continue leadership,
the TBD may appoint a new TBD or choose to alter the governance structure entirely.

## Policy

The TBD sets the project community's policies and makes decisions for the project community,
taking reasonable account of input from other project community members.

The TBD is responsible for implementing—or
delegating implementation of—policies and other decisions.

If members are not happy with the TBD's leadership,
they are free to voice their concerns or leave the project community.

## Process

Project community participants are free to discuss and debate project community policies, practices, and culture.

## Evolution

When the Steering Committee reaches 10 members, in addition to the TBD, the Steering Committee  will assume governance of the project community.
This control is activated upon the Steering Committee unanimously adopting a revised set of Governance instructions
that specifies how the Steering Committee will be chosen and make policy.
Until then, the TBD can change the governance structure of the project community at will.
