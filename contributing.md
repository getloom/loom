# Contributing to `@feltcoop/felt-server`

Thanks for your interest in contributing.
In order to keep our development velocity high,
we're currently practicing closed development on our open source projects,
meaning we publish our source code as we write it,
but most decisions are made in private among the core team.

We plan to publish a public roadmap and discuss increasingly more in public,
and the license is MIT, so you can do whatever you want with the code.
We're happy to discuss things on GitHub -
please feel free to
[open issues](https://github.com/feltcoop/felt-server),
and for private feedback email [team@felt.social](mailto:team@felt.social).

To develop, start here: ["Getting started"](/src/docs/getting-started.md)

The Felt project is governed by a
[Temporary Benevolent Dictator (TBD)](https://github.com/feltcoop/felt/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md),
[@feltcoop](https://github.com/feltcoop).
