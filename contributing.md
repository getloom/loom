We use the [MIT License](/LICENSE)
and we're currently practicing closed development --
we publish our source code as we write it,
but decision making mostly happens in private.
We plan to publish a public roadmap and discuss increasingly more in public.
We're happy to discuss issues on GitHub,
and for private feedback email [team@felt.social](mailto:team@felt.social).

More to come!
