# Contributing to `@feltjs/felt`

Thanks for your interest in helping!
To keep our development speed up,
[@feltjs](https://github.com/feltjs) makes most decisions in private,
but we are planning to develop open community-driven processes soon.
Our code is open source, so we publish it as we write it,
and [the license](LICENSE) is permissive, so you can do whatever you wish with the code.
See Felt's [GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/feltjs/felt/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md)

We plan to publish a public roadmap and discuss increasingly more in public.
For now please feel free to
[open issues](https://github.com/feltjs/felt/issues) on GitHub,
and for private feedback email [team@felt.social](mailto:team@felt.social).
See also the [known issues](https://docs.felt.dev/server/guide/user/known-issues).

[Pull requests](https://github.com/feltjs/felt/pulls)
are welcome for straightforward fixes and improvements,
but when there's non-obvious design choices or other ambiguities,
please open an [issue](https://github.com/feltjs/felt/issues)
to work out the details with the maintainers.

To develop, see [Getting started](https://felt.dev/docs/guide/admin/getting-started)

Felt is governed by a
[Temporary Benevolent Dictator (TBD)](https://github.com/feltjs/felt/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md),
[@feltjs](https://github.com/feltjs).
